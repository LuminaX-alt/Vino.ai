1. Gesture Control with OpenVINO
Short description: The MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer task lets you recognize hand gestures in real-time and provides the recognized hand gesture results along with the landmarks of the detected hands. You can use this task to recognize specific hand gestures from a user and invoke application features that correspond to those gestures. This project asks you to port MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer to OpenVINO and create a local gesture control system on a monitor. You can also customize the models in this pipeline according to task requirements.
